# Pour-Overview 
Pour Over is a per project Drupal 7 Development Environment based on docker containers for existing and new projects. It is designed for local development especially for developers using Acquia Cloud. 

Since one of the goals is day to day development we are going to vary from the completely isolated Docker applications and need some good ways to persist files and data, because many of us developers love to build 

The ultimate goal is turn key local Drupal development and site building to download Pour Over container add your drupal project code, boot containers, run and development. This is also designed for Mac OSX users, but could be tweaked for other systems. The primary reason is Boot2Docker makes things a little goofy since Docker is not running natively, but rather on a VM.

## What Pour Over is not
It is not a all in one custom configured build for every drupal project. 

If you want a more versatile tool look at Drupal Bowline

## How to use Pour Over

### Pour over convention over configuration
Since the goal of Pour Over is turn key development we have to make some trade offs. The good news is these trade offs actually make sense and enhance portability between systems. 

#### Source
#### Configs
#### Files
#### Database
